        "Ans:- Feature extraction is the process of identifying and extracting important features from data. In the context of CNNs, features are typically extracted from images. This is done by using a series of convolutional layers, which are responsible for detecting patterns in the image data. The output of the convolutional layers is a set of feature maps, which represent the different features that have been detected in the image. These feature maps are then used by the fully connected layers to classify the image or to perform other tasks."

        "Ans:- Adversarial attacks are a type of attack that tries to fool a machine learning model into making a wrong prediction. Adversarial attacks on CNN models typically involve creating a small perturbation to an image that is imperceptible to humans, but that causes the CNN to make a wrong prediction. There are a number of techniques that can be used for adversarial defense, such as adversarial training and input preprocessing."
